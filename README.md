Date Carmen is a simple JavaScript game, using mostly HTML,CSS (bootstrap), a mix of Canvas and DOM combined with JS.
This was my first project at IronHack's WedDev FullStack bootcamp. 

The main goal of the game is to cross the dance floor without hitting other caracthers. After reaching the bar, try to convice Carmen to go out on a date with you. Her reactinos will tell a lot if you are a good 'flirter'.
